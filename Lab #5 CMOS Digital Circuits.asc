Well man,

    Turns out it didn't go so well, I completed the CMOS SPICE circuit
in Mentor Graphics, but I wasn't sure what to do with the old design we
had.. I looked it over for a minute, and still couldn't understand. I
went to save the new circuit with the old one on the same sheet, I named
it "logic_broken.sheet". Seemed to save okay but with errors about how
the sheet was no longer in the project or something similar. I deleted
our older design, leaving only the rebuilt, larger new design. I fought
for about 45 minutes over "Net routing errors" untill I could enter
simulation mode. Looked like the Global circuit settings (all the
voltages and delays of the AC voltage supplies) didn't get saved, so I
had to redo that as well. Everything was routed and ready but I could
not run ELDO because of an error I had no idea how to troubleshoot. I
don't know if it was because I deleted all the original Y node, (I had
done a cut and pas)
